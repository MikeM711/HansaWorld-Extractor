# HansaWorld-Extractor

Extracts information from exported HansaWorld .xlsx sheets into information specific to AG workflow

Repository also includes my tests and results of the tests in their respective folders

Created a coding reflection in my ```HansaWorldExtract.py``` file of what I would do if I were to create this project again

 ## How To Use:
1. Put your exported HansaWorld Back Order .xlsx excel sheet in the same directory as ```HansaWorldExtract.py```
2. Run ```HansaWorldExtract.py```
 
The output will be the name of the file + ``` '- Extract.xls'```

Pretty fun program!
